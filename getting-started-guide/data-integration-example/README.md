## About the Data Source

Divvy is a Chicago-based bike sharing service. Every quarter, they release two data sets â€“ one file for every ride taken between two stations by customers throughout the quarter, and one that accounts for every Divvy station in the city.

This tutorial runs through a scenario using the Divvy Stations data for Q1 and Q2 2017, available in a public AWS bucket here: [Divvy\_Trips\_2017\_Q1Q2.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/divvy-data/tripdata/Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1Q2.zip). The [Setting up](setting-up.md) section covers all the steps to using Divvy Stations data from AWS.
