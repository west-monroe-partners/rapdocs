# Logical Architecture

As RAP operates differently than traditional ETL tools, this section provides a deeper dive of how RAP processes data, how data flows through RAP, and how RAP is logically organized.  The information presented in this section is helpful to know when architecting a new implementation leveraging RAP as the data processing tool of choice.

TODO - does this section overlap too much with "RAP Basics - How it Works" section?

TODO - identify high-level diagram showing everything

### Audience

The intended audiences for this section are the following:

* Data architects who have experience with traditional ETL tools and solutions and are seeking to understand how RAP works in anticipation of needing to lead a new RAP implementation.
* Cloud and application architects who are looking to understand how data moves through the RAP engine.
* Experienced RAP configurators who are looking to understand more deeply how RAP works \(the how and why behind the configuration\).
* Developers looking to gain a deeper understanding of what RAP does in anticipation of needing to work on RAP core processing code.
