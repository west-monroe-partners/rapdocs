# Raw Schema

## Viewing Raw Schema

After version 2.5.0, users can now view the raw attributes for their source. The Raw Schema tab is located between the Settings and Dependencies tab.

Raw attribute data will appear after inputs have completed their data pull.&#x20;

## Raw Metadata

Database columns may contain additional metadata. This can be viewed by clicking on the table icon in the Raw Metadata column on the Raw Schema table.&#x20;

After clicking the icon, a popup will appear with all of the raw metadata associated with that raw attribute.

If there is not any metadata associated with a column, the icon will be disabled. A tooltip can then be seen by hovering over the icon, "No metadata defined".&#x20;

## Updating Descriptions

Raw attribute descriptions can be created and updated via the Raw Schema tab. Simply click the row cell underneath the description column.

A popup will appear where users can input a description for the specific raw attribute.
