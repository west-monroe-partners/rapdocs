## Data View Tab

The Data View tab allows users to view a Source's data. Users can filter and sort the data to validate proper execution of enrichment and validation rules.

Column headers are color coded to indicate Raw versus Enriched data.

* **Blue Header:** Raw data from the Source
* **Green Header:** Enriched data generated by Enrichment Rules
* **Gray Header:** System data tracking data lineage and results of Validation Rule execution

Rows are color coded to indicate a record's Validation flag.

* **White Row:** Records that pass Validation
* **Yellow Row:** Records warned during Validation
* **Red Row:** Records failed during Validation

Users can filter results in a number of ways.

### Typing IQL

In the top bar, users can type in Intellio QL to filter the data. Using \[This\].field in the same way as an enrichment rule. Te \` key can also be used to access common spark functions.
