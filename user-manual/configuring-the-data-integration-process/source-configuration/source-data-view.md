# !! Data View

## Data View Tab

The Data View tab allows users to view a Source's data. Users can filter and sort the data to validate proper execution of enrichment and validation rules.

Column headers are color coded to indicate Raw versus Enriched data.

* **Blue Header:** Raw data from the Source
* **Green Header:** Enriched data generated by Enrichment Rules
* **Gray Header:** System data tracking data lineage and results of Validation Rule execution

Rows are color coded to indicate a record's Validation flag.

* **White Row:** Records that pass Validation
* **Yellow Row:** Records warned during Validation
* **Red Row:** Records failed during Validation

## Filtering Results

Users can filter results in a number of ways.

### Typing SQL

In the top bar, users can type in PostgreSQL queries to filter records. The statements will be evaluated after a `WHERE` clause is added to a `SELECT *` query.

### Selecting Columns

Users can select columns by clicking Select Columns. Users can add Descriptions, see Data Types, and check off which columns appear in the View Data tab.

TODO - new windows screenshot, what "Retain selection" switch does \(retains currently selected fields in the data viewer, adds new fields selected to view\)

### **Sorting Data**

Clicking a column's name sorts the data in ascending order. Clicking again switches to descending order.

## Analyzing Data

### Downloading Data

The Download button in the top right will download a `.csv` file of the data as it is filtered and sorted.

### Viewing Data Profiles

Clicking the Datatype icon brings up the data profile of that column. Different datatypes provide different data profile data.

A modal appears showing the data profile when the datatype icon is clicked.
