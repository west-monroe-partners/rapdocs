# Performing the Clone

As a reminder, this is the current setup of the environment.&#x20;

## Performing the Clone

We will clone the Company 1 Group and create a new Group called "Output Cloning". To perform the clone, follow the steps described [here](../very-basic-cloning-example/performing-a-basic-clone.md), this time updating the Group name to "Output Cloning". Be sure to validate all of the screen to ensure no unexpected objects are exported or cloned!



## The Results

The Multi Group Output now contains an additional Output Channel for "Output Cloning Sales Order Detail" as seen below.

The Company 1 Single Group Output has been left alone. It still only has one Output Channel mapped to Company 1 Sales Order Detail.

There is a newly created Output Cloning Single Group Output in the environment. It has the Output Cloning Sales Order Detail Source mapped into it.

The clone has been successfuly and preserved the desired user logic! The image below shows the new environment setup with the Output Cloning objects added.
