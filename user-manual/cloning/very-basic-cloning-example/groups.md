# Groups

Groups can take many different names in different orgainzations. Hubs, Groups, Companies, Targets, etc. are all terms that have been used on IDO projects to name the concept that is referred to within the platform as a "Group". Simply put, a Group is a self contained bundle of Sources.&#x20;

In the example seen on the Overview page there were two groups, Company 1 and Company 2. Each "Company" is separate and never relates directly to the other.  &#x20;

## Making A Group

Really, the Group is just a bit of text that helps name Sources. This is reflected in the fact that the Groups settings page in IDO has only two fields: Name and Description. Below we create a Group for Company 1 by simply naming it "Company 1".&#x20;

## Applying A Group To A Source

The group can then be applied to the relevant Sources by using the "Group" control on the Source Settings page. For the Company 1 example we have been working with, both the Company 1 Sales Order Detail and Company 1 Sales Order Header Sources would go into the Company 1 Group.

These Groups will be extremely important to the Cloning process. Users will choose to Clone an entire Group and recreate EVERYTHING inside of it with a new Group.&#x20;

Grouping together Sources helps logically separate entities within IDO. In the next section about Source Name Templates, we will investigate how IDO allow users to dynamically insert the GROUP name into Source names.
