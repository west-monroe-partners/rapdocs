# Example Setup

## The Setup

For this example, we have created 5 Sources matching the Sources seen in the Company 1 example.&#x20;

* Company 1 Sales Order Detail and Company 1 Sales Order Header are members of the Company 1 Group and each uses a Source Name Template.&#x20;
* Global Customers, Global Territories, and Global Products are no in a Group and do not use a Source Name Template.&#x20;
* 4 Relations exist. Sales Order Detail - Sales Order Header, Sales Order Detail - Global Product, Sales Order Header - Global Customer, and Sales Order Header - Global Territories. See the below image for the IDO representation of these relations.
* All of the Relations are Primary.
