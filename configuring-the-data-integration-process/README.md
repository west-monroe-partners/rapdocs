### Summary

This Configuration Guide provides detailed explanation of how to implement and configure DataOps within an enterprise environment.  The guide documents all the specifics and details of RAP's concepts including connections, sources, templates, and outputs.  

### Audience

The audience of this guide is intended for data engineers, data scientists, and DataOps configurators responsible for the implementation of DataOps and the subsequent analytic outputs. DataOps is designed for a technical user that has a basic understanding of data engineering, the underlying source systems, and the business requirements driving how the system is implemented and configured.  Given the maturity of RAP's feature and functionality, this guide provides a reference to system configurators looking for detailed understanding of all the system concepts and features.  

### Common Problems

The Intellio DataOps \(RAP\) user interface provides definitions of the input parameters.  Definitions and parameters are listed in the configuration guide, but  also included is a [Common Problems](common-problems.md) section with the purpose to route appropriate problems to the parameters and configuration that will solve these problems.
