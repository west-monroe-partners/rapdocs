# !! Manual Output

## Manual Output Tab

The Manual Output tab allows users to create a custom-defined output. There are filtering options available for users to define the output.

![Manual Output Tab](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28166%29.png)

The Manual Output tab displays the sources at the bottom of the screen and the following columns:

* **Output Source Name:** The Source Name.
* **Source Type:** The Source Type \(Timestamp or Key\)
* **Delete Type:** Allows a user to delete records from the destination of the Output.
  * **All:** All records in the destination are deleted and reloaded
  * **Range:** Records within the Range selected are deleted and reloaded. Only applies to Timestamp data.
* **Range Start:** The beginning of the Range. This filters the Source from the beginning of the Range, inclusively. Only applies to Timestamp data.
  * **Timestamp:** datetime value that the user can filter the **date\_column**.
  * **Range:** integer value that filters the **range\_column**.
* **Range End:** The end of the Range. This filters the Source to the end of the Range, inclusively. Only applies to Timestamp data.
  * **Timestamp:** datetime value that the user can filter the **date\_column**.
  * **Range:** integer value that filters the **range\_column**.
* **Status:** Icons showing the status of the Source after validation is ran.

## Choosing Sources

The first step for creating a Manual Output is choosing Sources. Select the **Add Source** button to open the Add Source modal.

The Add Source modal only displays the list of Sources that were selected in the [Output Mapping ](output-mapping.md)tab. The user can select a list of Sources and click **Apply** to add them to the Manual Output.

## Removing Sources

Clicking the Trash Icon from the Manual Output page removes the Source from the Manual Output.

## Validating the Manual Output

Manual Outputs must be Validated before running. Because mass re-outputs have large impacts on the Data Warehouse layer, and represent one of the more risky production impact operations, RAP has built in  pre-check processes prior to a full execution.

Click the Validate button at the bottom of the screen to validate each source and get the status of each Source.

Once the Validate button is pressed, the Sources are all validated. The Status will update to reflect the validation of each Source.

There are three possible Status values.

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/failed.png) **Failed**: Processing phase failed

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/completed.png) **Completed**: Processing phase successfully completed

## Running the Manual Output

Click the Submit button to run the Manual Output. All Completed Sources will run, while Failed Sources are ignored.
