# Sources

The fields in the Source Configuration vary based on the selected Source Type and Input Type. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for each Source type, and then for each Input type. To configure a Source, users must select both Source Type and Input Type.

## Sources Screen

On the Sources screen, users can see all previously created Sources, as well as search, edit, and filter them. By default, only Active Sources are listed. Users can change this by toggling the **Active Only** toggle. Note that only Active Sources are processed.

Each Source can be activated or inactivated by clicking the kebab button \(**⋮**\) on the right-hand column and selecting Activate or Inactivate.

To edit a Source, click the Source name in the list. This opens the Edit Source screen.

To add a Source, select **New Source**. This opens the Edit Source screen for a new Source.

## Edit Source Screen

There are many options for Source configuration. The [Source Details](source-details.md) page is the place to start when defining a Source.
