# !! Inputs

An "Input" is RAP’s atomic unit of data processing. Conceptually, an Input corresponds to a single file or scheduled Table pull from a configured Source. 

## Source Inputs Tab <a id="validations-screen"></a>

The Source Inputs screen allows users to monitor the status of their Sources' Inputs. If an Input has failed any steps, users can see the logs and investigate the failure.

Selecting any Input's field displays a modal with further details.

### Process Time Modal

Selecting an Input's **Process Time** value displays a modal with sub-times of each of the Input's different phases.

### Records Staged / Processed Modal

Selecting an Input's **Records Staged** or **Records Process** displays a modal with record counts at each of the Input's different phases. Each displayed Output links directly to its own page, providing an easy way to navigate a Source's configured Outputs.

### Processing Log Modal

To view the Processing Logs for any specific phase of an Input, click the corresponding Input Status icon.

The processing Log contains detailed information useful during troubleshooting. For more information about Processing Logs, see the [Operation Guide](../../operation-guide/).

## Statuses and Inputs

The Inputs tab provides insight into the processing of all stages for a given Source. The top of the page has a variety of filters, which allow filtering based on the status of all four processing stages, as well as the file path name.

Each row represents a file for each source and each column value represents the status of a particular processing phase \(Input, Staging, Validation & Enrichment, Output\).

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ready%20%281%29.png) **Ready**: Landing is prepared for processing phase – if the next phase is configured, it will automatically change to In Progress.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/queued.png) **Queued**: Process queued, waiting for free connections to execute.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pending%20%281%29.png) **Pending**: Phase is waiting on a dependent source to complete processing.

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/inprogress.png) **In-Progress**: Processing phase currently executing.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/warning.png) **Warning**: State of Source out of sync with destination table.

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/failed.png) **Failed**: Processing phase failed. Check detail modal to discover reason of failure.

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/completed.png) **Completed**: Processing phase successfully completed. Check detail modal to discover phase metadata.

## Controlling All Inputs

Users can control all of the Inputs for a Source using the options below. Not all options will be available depending on the current state of the Source.

* **Reset All Output:** Reset the Output phase for all Sources
* **Reset All Staging:** Reset the Staging phase for all Sources
* **Reset All Validation & Enrichment:** Reset the Validation and Enrichment phases for all Sources
* **Delete All Source Data:** Delete all stored data for the Source
* **View Data:** Navigate to the Data View tab
* **Pull Data Now:** Immediately generate a new Input for this Source

## Controlling One Input

Users can control individual Inputs with the options below. Certain options are enabled depending on the current state of the Source or Input. If the state of the Source or Input does not allow the user to reset a certain phase, the reason will appear to the left of the context menu when mousing over the option.

* **Reset Staging:** Reset the Staging phase for an Input
* **Reset Output:** Reset the Output phase for an in Input
* **Reset Validation & Enrichment:** Resets the Validation & Enrichment phase for an Input
* **Delete:** Delete the Input from the Source
* **View Data:** Navigate to the Data View tab - filter the data for only the selected Input
