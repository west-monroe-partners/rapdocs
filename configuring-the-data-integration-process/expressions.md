# !! Expressions

Expressions occur in many locations in the Intellio DataOps \(RAP\) user interface, such as Relations, Rules, ...

Expressions within Intellio DataOps \(RAP\) follows [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html). Spark SQL is negligibly different from basic SQL, so a proficiency in one typically implies a proficiency in the other.



{% hint style="info" %}
Across the Intellio DataOps \(RAP\) platform, a grey \(un-clickable\) "Save" button indicates there is an error. Typically this error is within an expression field. Double check errors and expressions if you are unable to "Save" your work.
{% endhint %}
