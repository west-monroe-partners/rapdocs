# Templates

Templates allow users to create and centrally manage re-usable code across multiple sources.

## Templates Screen

The Templates screen allows users to create and manage templates. There are two tabs: **Validations** and **Enrichments**. Both tabs only show Active templates. The **Active Only** toggle changes this setting.

## Creating Templates

Templates are generated by configuring a rule for a specific Source, then generating a template from that rule.

### Creating a Validation Rule Type

The bottom of the Edit Validation modal from the Source screen contains a **Save as Rule Type** button. Clicking this creates a Validation Template.

### Creating an Enrichment Rule Type

The bottom of the Edit Enrichment modal from the Source screen contains **Save as Rule Type** button. Clicking this creates a Enrichment Template.

## Managing Templates

### Editing Templates

Users can edit Templates within the Templates screen. Select a Template to display the Edit Modal.

In the Edit Modal, users can modify the Validation or Enrichment Rule template. Saving the template immediately applies the new logic to all Sources attached to the template.

### Applying Templates to Many Sources from the Templates Screen

Users may apply a Template on many Sources at once, eliminating the need to open up each Source separately. In the Validation and Enrichment Rule Templates screen, click the **Select Sources** button to display the Select Sources modal.

The Select Sources modal allows users to select multiple Sources and apply the Rule against it. Users can also search for specific Sources.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: A Source above is marked as **Has Dependents**, which prevents the Source from being deselected. This means that the Source not only already has the rule applied, but has additional Active rules configured that depend on the value output by the Template in question.
