### Prerequisites

Before RAP can be deployed, the following requirements need to be met:

* DNS name chosen for the target environment
* Auth0 account
* AWS or Azure account
* Administrator access to both AWS and Auth0 for the person who will be deploying the new RAP environment

### !! Deploying to Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)

TODO - what does client need to set up beforehand, what permissions needed for user performing deployment, what to run

### !! Deploying to Microsoft Azure

TODO - what does client need to set up beforehand, what permissions needed for user performing deployment, what to run

### !! Verifying the deployment

Once RAP is up and running, the [Data Integration Example](../getting-started-guide/data-integration-example/) in the Getting Started Guide can be followed to verify that the full RAP stack is working correctly.
