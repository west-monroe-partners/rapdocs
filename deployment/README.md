# !! Environment Management

This section explains how environments are set up, connected, and maintained. This section is divided into two main sections depending on the deployment environment: [Microsoft Azure](deployment-to-microsoft-azure/) and [Amazon Web Services](deployment-to-amazon-web-services/). Each main section contains the necessary information to go from Agent Installation through environment setup.

Also included in this section is the installation requirements of the RAP agent and best practices for environment management.

The audience for this section are data engineers and data architects who are setting up the Intellio DataOps instances. Those individuals installing the Intellio DataOps agents, standing up the Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services instances, and others working on the deployment team.
