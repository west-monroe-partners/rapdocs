# Prerequisites

DataOps has two main audiences it targets for configuring pipelines.

### Data Engineers

Data Engineers find DataOps as a means to more easily create, refine, and modify connections. Data Engineers often have a full background to explore DataOps' customizations and advanced features.

### BI/Report Builders

DataOps has an audience outside of data engineers who typically work on the output end of data bases. These users typically have a background in Business Intelligence programs or custom reporting efforts. For these professionals to make the most out of their usage with DataOps we recommend a general understanding of the following concepts.

* SQL \(SELECT statement parameters and syntax\)
* Database Manipulation and Calculation \(Joins, Groupings, Calculated Fields\)
* Data Frameworks \(Databases, warehouses, ETL, Connections\)
