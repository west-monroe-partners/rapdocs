# !! Monitoring the Process

### Overview

Day-to-day monitoring consists of checking the built-in operational dashboard, user created dashboards, statuses of daily production sources, and investigating issues that have happened during the nightly or morning load. When interrogating a potential issue, it is always best to start at the highest level and go from there. The highest level would be the operational dashboard, followed by the platform UI, and if necessary, going into AWS, Postgres and/or the application log files.
