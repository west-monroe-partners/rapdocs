  How to split up sources to ensure pre-calculated aggregations can be done
  efficiently.

# Rollup Sources

In some reporting scenarios, a hard copy of aggregate calculations has to be maintained to support the reporting layer.

TODO - replace this section with aggregate overview

TODO - add something about loopback pipeline \(RAP -&gt; Avro file -&gt; RAP\), when to use

TODO - is this section still needed with RAP 2.0 aggregate calculations?  Probably not as-is, should discuss recalculations here instead
