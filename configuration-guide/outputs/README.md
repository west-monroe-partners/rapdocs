# Outputs

## Outputs Screen

The Outputs screen allows users to see all previously created Outputs, as well as search, edit and filter them. By default, only Active Outputs are listed. Users can change this by toggling the **Active Only** toggle. Note that only Active Outputs are processed.

There are many options for what to input for an Output. The [Output Details](details.md) page is a good place to start for defining the Output.
