# End of support for versions RAP 1.7.x

{% hint style="danger" %}
1.7.x (RAP) will be End of Life and out of support on December 31st 2022
{% endhint %}

As part of the commercialization and licensing of the Intellio DataOps product (versions 2.5+), West Monroe will no longer be investing into or maintaining older versions of the platform starting January 1st 2023.

Customers who have yet to upgrade from v1.7.x (originally released September 2019) will no longer receive support on any submitted issues including bugs, feature enhancements, or hotfixes.

Please reach out to your West Monroe account executive to discuss how to upgrade your environment to the latest version.

Additionally, please inquire about the new support and licensing terms which improve the long-term engagement model, and how the newest versions can reduce your total cost of ownership of the platform.
