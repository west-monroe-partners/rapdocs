# 2.4.2 Quality of Life Improvments

## Intellio DataOps 2.4.2 Release 

Similar to 2.4.0, this release primarily focuses on quality of life features – as well as a few important performance improvements and bugfixes. Here are a few of the major additions: 

* Improved deployment automation 
* Increased stability around output type changes 

### Performance and Stability Optimizations 

#### Auto-populate System Configuration parameters during deployment 

By: Joe Swanson - Senior Consultant, Application & Infrastructure Engineering Lead  

During environment deployment, there is a manual step which requires the deployment team to connect to Postgres and manually update certain fields in the meta.system\_configuration table. This process is now automated in the Deployment container and the manual step will be removed from the deployment documentation. 

#### Delta Lake channel refresh process chains 

By: Joe Swanson - Senior Consultant, Application & Infrastructure Engineering Lead  

When Delta Lake output processes overwrite the Hive table, all other channels connected to the Output need to be reran to repopulate the table entirely. In 2.4.1, these processes would show up on the channel sources and would be labeled as “Triggered by Parallel Universe”. Now, these processes will show up in the process chain that triggered the channel refreshes and will be much more clearly tied to the head process.
