# Log4j Vulnerability Impact on IDO

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

At the highest level, we are unaffected. None of the custom services, including the agent, use Log4j - we leverage a different library called Logback and have regular penetration and OSS scans to remediate any known issues.​

Both AWS and Azure services were impacted. Databricks is not impacted.

## AWS <a href="#aws" id="aws"></a>

In AWS, Cloudwatch is used for public environments and could have been affected by the vulnerability. Due to the networking and security architecture and policies in place with our default deployment, a compromise of Cloudwatch in the DataOps environment is limited to a denial of services attack, which we have not seen to date.&#x20;

Data compromise would require access to the private encryption keys stored in the secrets manager in AWS, which was unaffected by this vulnerability.&#x20;

AWS has since patched and updated the service: [https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2021-006/](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2021-006/)​

## Azure <a href="#azure" id="azure"></a>

We do not use any of the Microsoft Azure services effected by this issue: ​[https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/#Azure-Application-Gateway,-Azure-Front-Door,-and-Azure-WAF](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/#Azure-Application-Gateway,-Azure-Front-Door,-and-Azure-WAF)​

## Databricks <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

Databricks could potentially use Log4j in specific scenarios, but they believe themselves to not be impacted - see their post here: ​[https://databricks.com/blog/2021/12/13/log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-research-and-assessment.html](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/12/13/log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-research-and-assessment.html)​

The Simba JDBC driver mentioned in the notes is not/was not used in any client deployments we are aware of. Both Tableau and PowerBI use a more secure connection to access data in Databricks.
