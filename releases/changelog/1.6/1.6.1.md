### Hotfixes <a id="Hotfixes"></a>

| Jira ID | Description | Problem | Impact | Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PROD-248 | Legacy Import/Export Support | Users need to promote sources between RAP 1.6 and RAP 1.5 while waiting for their prod releases | Users will be able to promote sources between RAP 1.6 and RAP 1.5 | Low - Affects source promotion between different environments. Will be deprecated after 1.6 is released to all environments |
| PROD-250 | Keyed Output deletes conflicting when hitting the same table | Keyed outputs from different output sources are deleting each other’s records when running at the same time | Adding the output send ID will prevent inadvertent deletes from occurring | Low - Better delete logic will prevent data from being inadvertently deleted |
| PROD-251 | Toggle to different source doesn’t change URL | Using the source drop down at the top of the sources page does not change the URL. This is confusing for users | The source dropdown will now change the URL | Limited - UI only |
| PROD-252 | DB deploy stability improvements | DB Deploy not working properly when deploying to new environments | DB deploy will work properly when deploying to new environments | None |
| PROD-253 | Dropdown selectors not responsive | Dropdown filters in the UI are not filtering the associated data after 1.6 deploy | Dropdown filters will now work | None |
| PROD-254 | New source button hidden in empty environments | If no sources exist, the Create Source button does not appear | Create source button now appears | None |
| PROD-255 | Output path missing from SFTP output | The output path parameter is missing from SFTP outputs, making them fail | Output\_path parameter added back in | None |
