# 1.7.1.1



## Features

### Agent Resource Configuration

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-1067
* **Problem**: Users needed to be able to set a max resourcing parameter to control how much the Agent can process at once. 
* **Impact**: This protects the Agent and source systems from now using all the resources on a server and ultimately can make environments much more stable. The maxResources parameter is added to the Agent Parameters JSON in the Agent table.
* **Risks**: Low

## Enhancements

### Logback Log Retention Update

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-1102
* **Problem**: Application logs from the Orchestrator and Agent were taking up a lot of space on servers
* **Impact**: Logs will be kept for 14 days at a max total size of 2GB now
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Reset Button Cases

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1063
* **Problem**: Reset Buttons were still being disabled/showing up in incorrect scenarios
* **Impact**: Reset buttons will behave as intended now
* **Risks**: Limited/None

## Bugfixes

### None Source Type Manual Output Only Outputting Latest Input

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1095
* **Problem**: When running a Manual Output on a None Refresh Type Source, only the latest input was output
* **Impact**: All inputs should be output in this scenario
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### New Agents Fail To Start

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1100
* **Problem**: Adding a new Agent to the Agent table would cause an Agent Code not found error due to having a null last\_transmission\_timestamp value
* **Impact**: Agents should be able to start up and connect if that field is null or populated
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Import/Export Failing

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1104
* **Problem**: Import/Export process was not taking some of the new backend changes into account - causing inability to use the process
* **Impact**: Import/Export now working
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Auto Reprocess Running On Inactive Effective Range Inputs

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1139
* **Problem**: Auto Reprocess has been triggering and running on older inputs that have their effective range marked as inactive
* **Impact**: This causes extra processing and sometimes failures in the platform - only active ranges should go through auto reprocess now
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Dependency Locks With Keyed Sources Waiting On Time Series Sources

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1096
* **Problem**: Edge case in dependency processing could cause a Keyed source to eternally wait on a Time Series source
* **Impact**: This would block up morning refreshes in certain environments. Processing should not be halted by the edge case anymore 
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### 404 Error In Staging Due To Input File Cleanup

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1124
* **Problem**: Race condition where Input would create a file in S3 but Cleanup would delete it before the Input process updated the input table to register the file
* **Impact**: We now register the file on the backend when the file is created
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Effective Range Not Showing Up For Sequence Source

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1092
* **Problem**: Clicking the Effective Range icon on a Sequence Source would not show the ranges
* **Impact**: Ranges are shown in the modal now
* **Risks**: Limited/None
