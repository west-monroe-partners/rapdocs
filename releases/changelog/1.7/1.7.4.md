# 1.7.4

## Enhancements

### Lineage Global Filtering

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1311
* **Problem:** Users struggled to create readable lineage graphs when working with complex source configurations
* **Impact:** Users will now be able to filter source and output lineage nodes with regex
* **Risks:** Low

### Delete Connection Button Added

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1316
* **Problem:** Users could not delete a Connection configured from the UI
* **Impact:** Users can now delete Connections that have been configured from the UI
* **Risks:** Low

### Delete Output Button Added

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-435
* **Problem:** Users could not delete an Output configured from the UI
* **Impact:** Users can now delete Outputs that have been configured from the UI
* **Risks:** Low

### Added Warning if User Attempts to Delete Remaining Data on a Key Source

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1192
* **Problem:** There was no way to prevent users from deleting all data on a Source that was being referenced by another Source for lookups.
* **Impact:** Users would find that their lookup rules did not function correctly because they had previously deleted all of the data in the Source they are referencing for the lookup.
* **Risks:** Low

###  Added Warning if User Changes the Tracking Column of a Source

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-242
* **Problem:** The user would not be reminded to re-stage Source data after changing the tracking column field of a Source \(the key\_columns, date\_column, or range\_column field of a Key, Timestamp, or Sequence Source, respectively\).
* **Impact:** After changing the tracking column of a Source, the user would attempt to ingest new data into the Source without first re-staging the existing data and find that their Source would have issues tracking changes in data. 
* **Risks:** Low 

## Bugfixes

### Reset Input from Validation & Enrichment does not Clear Output End Time

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-998
* **Problem:** When resetting an Input from the Validation & Enrichment phase, the Output End Time property would not be reset, leading to incorrect process time information.
* **Impact:** This was confusing for users who wanted to see when their Outputs had finished processing.
* **Risks:** Limited/None 

### Only Delete Actions should be Possible when Selecting Multiple Inputs on Full Sources

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1253
* **Problem:** When selecting multiple Inputs on Full Sources, the UI displayed actions that would result in the Source malfunctioning because the actions are not possible for multiple Inputs on Full Sources.
* **Impact:** This was confusing for users because it presented options that were misleading about the capabilities of Full Sources. 
* **Risks:** Limited/None
