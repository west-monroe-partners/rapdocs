### Agent Dies When Scheduler Hits Race Condition

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-774

### Increased Processing times on Keyed Sources without Window Functions

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-753
* **Problem:** Keyed Sources that processed deltas and did not have window function Enrichment rules were still having full source V&E runs applied during processing
* **Impact:** The full sources runs are unnecessary in this scenario and led to increased processing times

### Auto-Reprocessing Wait Logic Failing

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-762
* **Problem:** Auto-reprocessing wait logic was not executing as expected in certain scenarios
