## Features

## Enhancements

### Cleanup Queries Optimized

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-1034
* **Problem**: The queries to clean up the work and data tables were performing very poorly in environments that had a large amount of sources and inputs
* **Impact**: Cleanup will be much less expensive and demanding when it runs
* **Risks**: Limited/None

## Bugfixes

### Dependency Check Error

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1030
* **Problem**: When inputs that were waiting and logged into the Dependency Queue were deleted, they were not removed from the Dependency Queue. This caused failures when the queue was checked during processing.
* **Impact**: When an input is deleted it's information will now be cleared from the Dependency Queue
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Index On Output Send Table Causing Failure

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1033
* **Problem**: An index on Output Send table on the input\_ids column was causing issues in the platform
* **Impact**: The index has been removed
* **Risks**: Limited/None
