# 1.7.0.3

## Features

## Enhancements

### Manual Reset Staging Allocates Long Running Connection

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-835
* **Problem**: Manually resetting staging on a large amount of inputs would cause instability in the database/orchestration layer
* **Impact**: Users would lock up their platform when resetting staging on entire sources and would have to restart their services
* **Risks**: Low

### Schedule Run Updates

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-781, PROD-842, PROD-885
* **Problem**: The schedule run table would only be updated upon completion of an Input run. This caused issues with Agents that were deployed in unstable environments
* **Impact**: Scheduled Input runs will now enter a record into the stage.schedule\_run table when they begin their Input run and update it accordingly. The agent code will also be logged with the run to make it easier to see where the runs are coming from.
* **Risks**: Low

### Max-Open-Requests Parameter Increased

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-791
* **Problem**: Default max-open-requests value in Alpakka S3 was not enough for some clients pulling large amounts of data during their morning refreshes. 
* **Impact**: Inputs would fail and retry and leave many failed inputs behind for users to debug during their morning refresh.
* **Risks**: Limited/None

## Bugfixes

### Output Running on Inactive Effective Range Inputs

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-994
* **Problem**: After auto-reprocessing, a Range Delete Output would get queued and ran for Inputs even if they didn't have an active effective range
* **Impact**: Outputs will now only get queued up if the Input has an active effective range.
* **Risks**: Low

### Data Viewer Stability Issues

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-894
* **Problem**: Data Viewer would cause platform crashes if users were trying to use the filter on large datasets
* **Impact**: Data Viewer will now be able to handle and recover from more intensive filtering and usage.
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Data Viewer Not Showing All Records

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-895
* **Problem**: Filtering the Data Viewer would sometimes show users a fraction of the records that it should
* **Impact**: Data Viewer should now show the correct amount of records to users
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Line Terminator in Data breaking Snowflake Output

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-899
* **Problem**: Switching Snowflake to write CSV files on the backend to prepare the data for Snowflake ingestion caused inputs with line terminator characters in their data to fail Output
* **Impact**: Snowflake CSV writing can now handle line terminator characters in the data
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Missing Landing Work Table During Validation and Enrichment

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-944
* **Problem**: Cleanup was cleaning up work tables that it shouldn't have, leading to Validation failures when the process couldn't find the work tables for the Input
* **Impact**: Work table cleanup has been made less aggressive
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Logout Link with MFA Enabled Sitewide Doesn't Work

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-792
* **Problem**: When using Auth0 MFA on the platform, the logout button did not log the user out
* **Impact**: The user should now successfully be able to log out of the platform
* **Risks**: Limited/None
