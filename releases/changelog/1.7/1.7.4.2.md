### Records With Null Byte Characters Fail to Stage

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1373
* **Problem**: Source data that contained the null byte character \('\0'\) would not process successfully in Staging
* **Impact**: No way to workaround this unless the source data is edited - Staging will now substitute the null byte character with a string representation of it \("\0"\).
* **Risks**: Limited/None
