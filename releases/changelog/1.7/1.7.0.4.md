# 1.7.0.4

## Features

## Enhancements

### Serverless DB JDBC Connection Issues

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-813
* **Problem**: With the transition of new environments to use Aurora Serverless, there were some issues with how our JDBC connection pool handled the Serverless DB opening and closing connections
* **Impact**: Serverless DB scaling and connection cleanup should not cause the Orchestrator to crash any more
* **Risks**: Low

### Stuck Inputs

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-830
* **Problem**: Table inputs that had API connectivity issues while in progress would sometimes be stuck in progress until the Agent was manually restarted
* **Impact**: Stuck inputs would cause the source to not pull a new input until the input was resolved. Fixing this issue will require less manual intervention from users during morning refreshes
* **Risks**: Low

### Cleanup Updates

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-982, PROD-1007
* **Problem**: Work table cleanup and process table cleanup were taking a long time in environments that were pulling a large amount of data and inputs every day
* **Impact**: Optimized Cleanup should cause less contention with daily processing in the platform
* **Risks**: Low

## Bugfixes

### Output Source Override for Delete Type with Effective Range

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-1009
* **Problem**: Output Source parameters were not overriding correctly when dealing with effective ranges
* **Impact**: Output Sources should not be taken into account when doing process queueing around effective range inputs
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### History Records Not Being Marked with a Validation Status Code

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-1015
* **Problem**: Key History records were not being updated with the proper validation\_status\_code
* **Impact**: Users experienced inaccurate results when attempting to work with or output the key history records
* **Risks**: Limited/None
