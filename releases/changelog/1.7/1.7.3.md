# 1.7.3

## Features

### Display Version Number on UI

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1220
* **Problem**: Users did not have a way of easily knowing what version of RAP they were using from the UI
* **Impact**: Mousing over the RAP icon at the top of the page will now display the current RAP version \(starting with 1.7.3\)
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Documentation and Support Links Added to Main Menu

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1247
* **Problem**: There was no visible and intuitive way to access RAP documentation or the Support Portal from the UI
* **Impact**: Documentation and Support links will now be visible and will direct the user to the appropriate sites when clicked in the main menu
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Automated DateTime Format parsing in Staging

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-702
* **Problem**: Users would often get stuck trying to figure out the proper format for the datetime\_format parameter when configuring a Source with the Timestamp or Key refresh types. 
* **Impact**: Datetime\_format is now an advanced parameter, and will be used as an override parameter - any source already set up with a valid datetime\_format parameter will still use that as an override, but users can now remove that field or not fill it in entirely when setting up a source and RAP will infer the datetime\_format for the user.
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Cleanup Data Tables for Non-Effective Range Inputs

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1185
* **Problem**: Effective range calculations on time series sources would show the user which inputs had "effective" time series data, but leave all the "non-effective" data still in the storage layer - leading to extra storage data used and costs building up
* **Impact**: Based on user configuration, when an input has no effective data, it will have its data tables dropped during the cleanup process. Users can still revive these data tables by rerunning Validation on the non-effective inputs.
* **Risks**: Low

### Inputs Filterable by Effective Range

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1215
* **Problem**: There was not an easy way to quickly view only the inputs with effective ranges for a given source
* **Impact**: A toggle added to the Inputs tab will now let the user choose if they want to view inputs with effective ranges only
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Validations and Enrichments Sortable by Last Updated Timestamp

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1004
* **Problem**: There was not an easy way to see or sort validation or enrichment rules for a source by last\_updated\_timestamp
* **Impact**: Users will easily be able to find recently updated rules for troubleshooting or development purposes
* **Risks**: Limited/None

## Enhancements

### Reduce Key Data Table Logging During Cleanup Process

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1241
* **Problem**: Logs were getting very large in certain environment due to some verbose logging during the Cleanup process, specifically during the Key Data Table Cleanup
* **Impact**: Users were having to dig through larger than necessary log files when they needed to investigate issues
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Agent Logging in UTC

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1245
* **Problem**: It was confusing for users to have the Agent log timestamp be in Agent local time when the rest of the platform logs in UTC
* **Impact**: Agent log timestamps should now be in line with the rest of the platform
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Plugin Update Process Stability

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1206, DEV-1207
* **Problem**: The Agent plugin initialization process did not have auto update logic built for the various plugin helper files and was not throwing errors when it couldn't find the required files
* **Impact**: When auto update is enabled for an Agent, it will now check to see if any of the plugin files are updated when doing auto update checks. Errors will be thrown in the Agent logs if files can't be found.
* **Risks**: Low

### Added Icon to Show if Data Table\(s\) Exist for a Given Input

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1214
* **Problem**: There was no way to see if a data table existed in the Postgres storage layer for a given Input
* **Impact**: An icon with a tooltip will now be shown next to the Validation status icon if the data table\(s\) for that input have been deleted or archived.
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Auth0 Libraries Updated in UI and API to Prepare for Browser Security Patches

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1234
* **Problem**: Web browsers are tightening security in 2020 and this could affect Auth0 Third Party Extensions. Read more [here](https://auth0.com/blog/browser-behavior-changes-what-developers-need-to-know/)
* **Impact**: We do not use Extensions or Cookies in our application so we should not be affected by these changes, but it's better to be safe than sorry!
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Clear Graph Takes User to Search Screen 

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1105
* **Problem**: When using the Lineage feature, clicking the Clear Graph button would not take the user to the search screen
* **Impact**: The search screen is where you start a new Lineage graph, so users would have to leave the page or refresh the browser to start a new graph
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Source Can't be Saved if Bad Schedule is Entered

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-997
* **Problem**: There was no validation when entering schedules for scheduled input, so users would need to check the agent logs to make sure their sources were getting scheduled correctly
* **Impact**: Users can no longer save a source with an incorrect schedule configured \(unless disable schedule is selected\)
* **Risks**: Limited/None

## Bugfixes

### Reset All Validation Resets Validations on Invalid Inputs

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1260
* **Problem**: Clicking reset all validation can reset validation for inputs that haven't passed Validation yet
* **Impact**: This can cause locking or extra processing for the source
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Source Can be Saved Without Choosing a Connection

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1260
* **Problem**: Users could save a source without selecting a Connection
* **Impact**: This causes failures and errors during the Input process
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Snowflake Output Breaks When Writing Nulls

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1221
* **Problem**: The process we use to copy data into Snowflake tables did not have support for NULL data
* **Impact**: Nulls can now be written to Snowflake and there is differentiation between NULL and empty string as well
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Pull Now Passes On Error Retry to Next Scheduled Input

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1239
* **Problem**: When an Input is pulled with the Pull Now button, we do not do any error retries for the immediate pull
* **Impact**: That lack of error retries was getting passed on to the next scheduled input that ran for the source, causing that input to not do any error retries during it's usual refresh run
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Source Name Does Not Update Upon Renaming a Source Until User Refreshes

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-512
* **Problem**: Renaming a source would not reflect the new name on the Inputs screen until the user refreshed the page
* **Impact**: Confusion for users
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Text Qualifiers Were Ignored When Writing File Outputs

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-561
* **Problem**: We have a text qualifier parameter in the File Output configuration, but it was being ignored
* **Impact**: Files were always being qualified as if they were comma separated and qualified with double quotes
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Users Needed to Refresh Page to do Manual Output After Output Mapping 

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-804
* **Problem**: When mapping an Output, users would have to refresh the page before the Manual Output would work correctly
* **Impact**: This was confusing for users and caused unnecessary site refreshing
* **Risks**: Limited/None

### Select All on Inputs Page Breaks After Selecting All Then Deleting

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-829
* **Problem**: Selecting all inputs and deleting them would cause the Select All to error out
* **Impact**: Users would not be able to use Select All 
* **Risks**: Limited/None
