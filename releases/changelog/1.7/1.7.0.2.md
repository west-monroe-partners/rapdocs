# 1.7.0.2

## Features

## Enhancements

### Manual Reset Validation Follows Wait Logic

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-588
* **Problem**: Manually resetting validation through the UI would bypass the dependency queue and immediately begin running the validation process
* **Impact**: This could cause locking or incorrect data enrichments/validations
* **Risks**: Low

### Agent Resilience

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-781
* **Problem**: Agents that ran in environments with connectivity issues would experience duplicate inputs or sometimes no inputs being run at all
* **Impact**: Morning refreshes were inconsistent and difficult to troubleshoot
* **Risks**: Low

### Connection Pool and Connection Manager Resilience

* **JIRA ID**: PROD-785
* **Problem**: Postgres crashes/patches would cause the connection pool within the Orchestrator to go down until the application was manually restarted
* **Impact**: Processes would become queued but would never run
* **Risks**: Low

## Bugfixes

### Window Function Enrichments on Key Sources Causing Crashes

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-771
* **Problem**: Creating a window function enrichment on a large Key source could cause slow rule processing and crashes in certain cases

* **Risks**: Low

### Lookup Table Missing Error in Validation Process

* **JIRA ID:** PROD-776
* **Problem**: Sources were failing Validation and Enrichment due to missing lookup tables
* **Impact**: This would cause platform processing to be held up indefinitely
* **Risks**: Low

### Deadlocks in Validation due to Auto Reprocess Wait Logic
