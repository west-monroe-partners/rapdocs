### Lookup Refresh Workflow Logic Causing Ghost Validations to Run

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-1240
* **Problem**: An edge case in the workflow logic for the Lookup Refresh process would enqueue Validation processes when they didn't need to be ran
* **Impact**: Validations would run out of sync with the normal workflow, sometimes causing failures on older inputs
* **Risks**: Limited/None
