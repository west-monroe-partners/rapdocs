# 2.1.5

* **Automap saving mappings to other output-sources**

  * Fixed issues with Output channel automapping for Source columns

* **SQL Server Output automatically runs CCI index creation script, causing Output failure**

  * Added output settings parameter 'Create Cci On Table' for SQL Server outputs. To control whether or not the columnstore index is created on the output table

* **Workflow Queue: Inability to reprocess failed old inputs in 2.1**

  * Older keyed inputs will be able to have a Reset CDC called on them. It will rollback the hub table to the point in time when that input first came in, then reprocess everthing newer.

* **2.0: Create a trim option for table sources**

  * Table Ingestion sources now have the ability to trim whitespaces characters on String data fields

* **Issue exporting multiple sources at once**

  * Users can now export more than 200 sources at once. Previously this would cause failures.

* **SFTP Connection subtype being set to null is breaking agent**

  * SFTP Ingestion bugfixes for AWS environments

* **Users cannot change Operation Type in output source mapping**
  * Changing operation type of an Output Channel from Aggregate to N/A will now work.
