# 2.5.0 - April 11th 2022 Hotfix

### **Output mapping expression not updating when enrichment attribute name is changed**

Updating the attribute\_name of an enrichment will now be properly reflected in output mappings using that enrichment

### **Don't let job that fails to start fail a process that's already been picked up**

When multiple clusters were running and new clusters failed to launch, some processes were being run twice. This has been fixed and will no longer happen.

### **Custom Ingests are always case sensitive**

The force case insensitve parameter will now correctly convert column names into lowercase when marked as True.\
\
Some Custom sources may be affected by this bug and already exist with mixed-case columns. If this is the case, we have set up the deployment to fail with a message referencing ticket DEV-3081. Please reach out and we will guide you through changing the source to case sensitive or updating all columns names to be lower case.

### **Aggregate output sources have incorrect delete query for Snowflake output**

Aggregate outputs weren't working with Snowflake

### **Refresh failed with error: Cannot overwrite a path that is also being read from.. Retrying.**

Fixed an issue with initial location of hub table partition not being versioned
