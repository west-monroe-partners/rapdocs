# 2.5.0 - March 10th 2022 Hotfix

### **Clarity updates for Custom Ingest/Parse/Post Output Cluster Configs**

Updated the parameter names to say "Custom Ingest Cluster Config", "Custom Parse Cluster Config", and "Custom Post Output Cluster Config" rather than just "Cluster Config".&#x20;

Added Custom processes to the Process Config Process Override screen as unselectable options with tooltip to explain where to configure them.

### **Added indices on history.process**

Added 3 indices to this history.process table to improve performance

### Fixed Import to not mess with old deactivated uv\_flag enrichments.

This was causing failures on import in some environments

### Custom Post Output not running

Fixed workflow so Custom Post Output process will be enqueued properly.
