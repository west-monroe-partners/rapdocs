![](https://arn-resources.upraise.io/841a435c-88f0-35f3-a8dc-65da0b4cb26d/10000/1031/images/arn_file_2021-01-12-19-36-09-528.png)

**Issues:**

* **Process getting stuck in workflow queue**

  * In progress parsings will be marked as failed when the core is shut down.

* **Empty Output Mappings Breaking file outputs**

  * Unmapped fields in CSV, Text, Json, and CSV outputs will no longer cause failures.

* **Allow cross AWS account input**

  * Access key, secret key, and region can now be configured for AWS S3 connections. Allowing cross account ingestion.

* **Inactivating Rule Template Doesn't Inactivate Dependent Rules**

  * Fixed issue where updates to a template's active status were not reflected on dependent rules

* **Template Export/Import - Only use parsed expressions**

  * Template rules and relations can be exported and imported into other environments. However, they will only migrate their parsed out expressions. They will not migrate templates or tokens.

* **Throw error if user changes connection from source to output or vice versa and its used.**

  * An error will be thrown if a users changes the connection direction while it is actively used.

* **Improve Agent source table query performance**

  * Increased performance of Agent source table query to prevent crashing.

* **Deployment Actor not completing with Log Analytics**

  * Deployment actor in Azure environments will now be able to update containers that have a Log Analytics workspace applied to them via Diagnostic settings

* **Agent or Schedule Not working**

  * Schedules did not work for Oracle Plugins

* **Build UI screens for relation templates**

  * Relation Templates are now available in the UI. Users can create/update/delete relation templates as well as link various sources to their templates. Tokens can be used in many areas of the relation templates in order to make more efficient templates.

* **Build data/API for relation templates**

  * Data/API backend for temapltes

* **Ingestion Failing with no listed Error, looks like Agent is crashing**

  * Fixed issue with plugin ingestions running and causing an agent crash before the plugins were initialized

* **Clean Non-functioning Ingest/Output Items from UI**

  * Removed non-supported ingestion and output types from the connection screens

* **Build Out 'Inactivate Channel' Functionality**

  * Fixed a bug related to Channel deactivation

* **Separate 'Delete All Source Data' Into Two Distinct pseudo-Processes**

  * Split the 'Delete All Source Data' Button into two buttons: Delete Source Data and Delete Source Metadata. This will allow users to reset sources to their initial states if needed

* **Toggling Force Case Insensitive Parsing Param after initial input breaks sources**

  * Updated the description and default value of the 'Force Case Insensitive' source parameter. All new input column names will be entirely lower case by default now

* **Snowflake Temp Table Drop Race Condition**

  * Output temp tables will now have process IDs in their name to avoid conflict.

* **Move agent attribute from source/output to connection in UI and DB tables**

  * Agent dropdown has been moved from Source settings to Connection settings page. New "Connection Direction" attribute is added to Connection, making connection objects Source or Output-specific. Legacy connections are automatically migrated during upgrade. If legacy connection has been used for both Source and Output, new Output connection will be created and assigned to outputs with "RE-SAVE SENSITIVE PARAMETERS" suffix. Please check connections list after upgrade, re-enter sensitive attributes and re-save connection for secure encryption.

* **Agent Screen - Ability to configure Plugin metadata**

  * Plugin metadata now shows up in Agent settings page

* **Templates: update Enrichment popup**

  * Enrichment popup on source screen with now show a link if it is a template rule. Template rules also cannot be edited from the source screen. Rules can be linked/unlinked from templates.

* **Output Mapping Screen performance**

  * Output mapping has been updated to use pagination instead of an endless horizontal scroll bar. This reduces the UI memory load when rendering thousands of columns. Users can still filter column names with this new pagination.

* **Column resize on Rules tab freaks out**

  * Improved UI responsiveness when resizing columns on the rules tab

* **Azure Private Postgres Endpoint**

  * Added parameterization for private facing resources in Azure terraform script

* **Rules Templates: UI**

  * Created a user interface to create, update, and delete Rule Templates.

*  **Rules Templates: data + APIs**

  * Basic Rule Template functionality has been implemented but is still in beta. Users should be able to successfully configure Rule templates, and assign those templates to sources.

* **Templates: global token management data + APIs**

  * Basic Token functionality has been implemented but is still in beta. Users should be able configure tokens, assign tokens to sources, and use tokens across different source entities

* **Templates: build global token management screen**

  * Tokens are now available in the UI. Users can create tokens with a default value and then assign individual values across many sources. The source settings screen also has a token table a available for quickly assigning tokens, and token values, to that source.

* **Presigned URLs/Temp Keys for S3 uploading \(API to Agent\)**

  * AWS uploads will now use temporary credentials rather than permanent account credentials.

* **Secure API routes to only return connection information specific to Agent**

  * Secured Agent API calls accessing sensitive source system connection data. Each Agent now has access only to its own connection data. To facilitate automatic agent upgrade, make sure to deploy version 2.2 before upgrading to 2.3+ otherwise legacy agents will be unable to self-update and will require manual upgrade

* **Compile Agent code with a code obfuscator**

  * Obfuscated Agent jar to reduce jar size and protect against decompiling

* **Update RapAgentBat service to have lower privileges**

  * The DataOps agent installer will now require a windows account and password to run the service instead of using LocalSystem.

* **Entering tick mark in rule expression no longer reveals Spark SQL function drop down**

  * Fixed

* **S\_input\_id in Data causing failure in Enrichment**

  * s\_input\_id in the source data should no longer cause failures during Enrichment

* **Update RapAgentBat service to have lower privileges**
  * The DataOps agent installer will now require a windows account and password to run the service instead of using LocalSystem.
