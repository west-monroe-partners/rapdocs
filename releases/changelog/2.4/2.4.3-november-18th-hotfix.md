# 2.4.3- November 18th Hotfix â€‹

## Enrichment parameter parser picking wrong relation\_id <a href="schema-lock" id="schema-lock"></a>

Enrichment parameter parser was picking the wrong relation\_id and throwing parse errors.

## Agent Table Ingestion failing on CTE source queries <a href="snowflake-0-record-outputs" id="snowflake-0-record-outputs"></a>

CTE source queries for Agent table ingestion were running the entire query result set for metadata and row count gathering. Now, the query will be manipulated to pull a smaller result set of 0 or 1 records.

## Incorrect source status for Full refresh sources <a href="snowflake-0-record-outputs" id="snowflake-0-record-outputs"></a>

Source status is now correctly marked as Failed for a failed ingest on a Full refresh type source
