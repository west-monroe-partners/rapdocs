# Support Version Lifecycle

In order to maintain the best possible service levels for customers, triage and debugging support is only provided to a limited number of release versions.

New minor releases are provided roughly once every 2 months, and new major releases are provided roughly twice a year.

Intellio provides full support for both the current version, as well as the latest release of the previous released minor version.

This includes major version upgrades, meaning customers have a roughly 2 month window to upgrade their systems in the case of a major release.

Starting with v2.5.1/5.1.0 we are moving to the industry standard naming convention for release versioning as defined at [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org) and removing the prefix of "2" from our releases.

This new format is \<major>.\<minor>.\<hotfix>
